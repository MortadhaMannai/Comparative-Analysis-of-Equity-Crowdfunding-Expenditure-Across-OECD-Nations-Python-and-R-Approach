------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Author: Manai Mortadha 

## Project Overview

This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of the differences in money spent on "Equity Crowdfunding" projects across OECD countries. The analysis will delve into various independent variables that may contribute to these differences, including economic factors, open-mindedness, social awareness, sense of security, and technology awareness.

## Independent Variables

### Economic Factors
- **GDP Value:** Gross Domestic Product value of each country.
- **PPP (Purchasing Power Parity):** Measure of economic strength considering cost of living and inflation.

### Open-Mindedness
- **Number of Foreign Languages Spoken:** Indicator of cultural diversity and open-mindedness.

### Social Awareness
- **Electoral Turnout:** Percentage of eligible voters participating in elections.
- **Percentage of People Working in R&D Sectors:** Reflects the focus on innovation and progress.

### Sense of Security
- **European Patent Office Patents Gained (per Habitant):** Patents filed for innovation.
- **Number of Violations Reported by Residents:** Indicator of governance and safety.

### Technology Awareness
- **Number of Purchases Made Online:** Illustrates technology adoption and e-commerce.
- **Percentage of People Working in IT:** Demonstrates technology proficiency.

## Data Source and Analysis Methods

The project utilizes data from the Eurostat database, encompassing the latest available years (with the oldest data, specifically electoral turnout, extending to 2011).

The analysis unfolds gradually and employs a range of methods:
- Basic Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Random Forest Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Apriori Algorithm (for market basket analysis)
- Clustering Techniques

The project's analysis is conducted using both Python and R programming languages to ensure a comprehensive examination.

## Focus on Equity Crowdfunding

The project solely focuses on "Equity Crowdfunding," which involves the issuance of securities. This form of crowdfunding is distinct due to its regulation in most countries. As such, it provides trustworthy and credible sources of information for analysis.
